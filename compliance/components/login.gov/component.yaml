        login.gov uses strong multi-factor authentication to authenticate users.
        It can authenticate using PIV/CAC for federal employees, and uses other
        standards compliant multi-factor authentications for non-federal users,
        such as phones, FIDO keys, authentication code applications, etc.

        The upload app admin functionality takes care of user/account management.
