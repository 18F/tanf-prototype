# Restart the queue every 60 minutes
# If things take longer than 60 minutes to import, we may have to 
# revisit this.

# Another way to do this is to set up your CI/CD system to periodically
# run something like this every hour:
#    cf run-task tanf python manage.py process_tasks --duration=3540
